# MySQL Chatbot with Gemini-Pro

This project develops a chatbot that interprets natural language queries, generates SQL queries, and fetches results from a SQL database in an intuitive, user-friendly way. It leverages the Gemini-Pro model and integrates with the Streamlit GUI for an enhanced interactive experience.

## Features
- **Natural Language Processing**: Employs Gemini-Pro to accurately interpret and respond to user queries in natural language.
- **SQL Query Generation**: Automatically creates SQL queries from the user's natural language input.
- **Database Interaction**: Connects to a SQL database to fetch results, showcasing real-world database interactions.
- **Railway storage database**: Upload Chinook.sql to database railway for deployment.
- **Streamlit GUI**: Provides an intuitive interface built with Streamlit, accessible to users of all skill levels.
- **Python-based**: Fully developed in Python, highlighting best practices in modern software development.
## How the Chatbot Works?

The chatbot takes a user's natural language query and converts it into a SQL query using Gemini-Pro. It then executes the query on a SQL database and presents the results back to the user in natural language. This process involves multiple steps of data processing and interaction with the GOOGLE API and a SQL database, all seamlessly integrated into a Streamlit application.
